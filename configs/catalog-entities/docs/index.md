!!! tip "RHDH Proudly Based On CNCF Backstage"

    Developer Hub is based on [Backstage](https://backstage.io) the open-source Internal Developer Portal (IDP) created by Spotify and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). CNCF Backstage enjoys a vibrant user community and a fast growing ecosystem of useful extensions called "[plugins](https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh/plugins "plugins")". Many leading platform vendors (including  Red Hat) are contributing [code](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh "source code") to the [Backstage project](https://github.com/backstage/backstage) to ensure the developer experience is as rich and rewarding as possible.
