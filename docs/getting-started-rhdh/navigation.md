When you first open Red Hat Developer Hub, you'll notice two main navigation areas: the **Global Header** at the top and the **Left Hand Navigation** sidebar. Understanding these areas is key to efficiently using Developer Hub.

!!! note "RHDH vs. Backstage UI"
    While Red Hat Developer Hub shares many UI similarities with CNCF Backstage, the Global Header in RHDH has been customized with additional features and components specific to the Red Hat Developer Hub experience.

## Using the Global Header

The Global Header is your primary toolbar, always visible at the top of the screen. It provides quick access to the most commonly used features and functions in Developer Hub.
