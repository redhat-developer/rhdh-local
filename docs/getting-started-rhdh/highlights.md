Red Hat Developer Hub provides several key features that help development teams work more efficiently. This page explains what these features are and how they can help you in your daily work.

!!! info "Turn-key Solution 🚀"

    Red Hat Developer Hub is a pre-configured, production-ready platform. Unlike CNCF Backstage (the open-source project it's based on), which typically requires coding and manual plugin integration, Red Hat Developer Hub comes ready to use out of the box.
    
    This means you don't need to rebuild the application or spend extensive time on setup. Platform engineering teams can focus on configuring it for their organization rather than building the infrastructure from scratch.

!!! info "Unified Interface 🪟"

    Red Hat Developer Hub provides a single, consistent interface that brings together your applications, services, teams, documentation, and APIs in one place. Instead of switching between multiple tools and systems, you can find everything you need in one location.
    
    The platform supports dynamic plugins that are compatible with Backstage, allowing you to add integrations with your existing tools without requiring application rebuilds.

!!! tip "Software Templates for Consistency 🏆"

    Software Templates help standardize how new projects are created. Platform engineers can create templates that capture your organization's best practices and workflows. When developers use these templates, new projects automatically follow your standards for project structure, CI/CD configuration, security settings, and more.
    
    This helps ensure consistency across projects and reduces the time developers spend on repetitive setup tasks. Learn more in [Understanding & Using Templates](templates.md).

!!! info "Self-Service Capabilities ⚡"

    Red Hat Developer Hub enables self-service workflows, which means developers can perform common tasks without waiting for IT tickets or approvals. For example, you can create new projects, access documentation, view service dependencies, and more—all through the interface.
    
    This reduces wait times and allows developers to be more productive. Common tasks that might have required tickets or meetings can now be completed directly in the platform.

!!! note "Extensible with Plugins 🔌"

    Red Hat Developer Hub is compatible with many Backstage plugins, giving you access to a wide range of integrations and features. You can integrate with systems for project management, security scanning, CI/CD pipelines, observability, monitoring, infrastructure management, testing, and more.
    
    Plugins can be added dynamically without rebuilding the application, making it easy to extend the platform's capabilities as your needs grow.

!!! info "Enterprise Support 🛡️"

    In addition to community resources from the Backstage open-source community, Red Hat Developer Hub includes enterprise support from Red Hat. This means you have access to technical support, security updates, and issue resolution from Red Hat's support team.
    
    For more information, see [Red Hat Support](https://www.redhat.com/support).

!!! info "Flexible Deployment Options ☁️"

    Red Hat Developer Hub runs on any Kubernetes distribution that conforms to the Kubernetes API, including Red Hat OpenShift, AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE, and others.
    
    The platform can also be deployed on-premises or in air-gapped environments for organizations that require additional privacy and security controls.
