Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) is an **Internal Developer Portal** that brings together all the tools, services, and information your development teams need in one unified interface. Think of it as your team's central command center for building, deploying, and managing software. In this getting started guide, you'll learn the fundamentals of RHDH, understand its key features and benefits, and discover how to navigate and use the platform effectively to improve your daily development workflow.

!!! tip "Built on Open Source Innovation"
    RHDH is based on [CNCF Backstage](https://backstage.io), the open-source Internal Developer Portal created by Spotify. This means you get all the power and flexibility of Backstage, plus enterprise-grade support and additional features from Red Hat.

### The Developer Experience Problem

Modern software development is complex. Developers often find themselves:

* **Jumping between tools**: GitHub, Jira, Jenkins, monitoring dashboards, documentation sites
* **Searching for information**: "Where's the API documentation?" "How do I deploy this service?" "Who owns this component?"
* **Repeating setup work**: Creating new projects, configuring CI/CD pipelines, setting up monitoring
* **Losing context**: Switching between multiple tabs and applications to understand a single service

This context switching and information hunting slows down development and increases frustration.

### How RHDH Solves This

Red Hat Developer Hub consolidates everything into a **single, searchable portal** where developers can:

!!! success "Discover Everything"
    Find all your applications, services, APIs, and documentation in one place. No more hunting across multiple systems.

!!! success "Self-Service Everything"
    Create new projects, deploy services, and access resources through automated templates and workflows—no tickets required.

!!! success "Understand Everything"
    See relationships between services, view documentation, check API contracts, and understand dependencies at a glance.

!!! success "Extend Everything"
    Add plugins and integrations to connect your favorite tools, from CI/CD pipelines to monitoring dashboards.
