# RHDH Local

The fastest and simplest way for platform engineers to test Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) features locally.

RHDH Local lets you quickly test software catalogs, TechDocs, plugins, templates, and configurations without needing a cluster. Perfect for individual development and testing on your laptop, desktop, or homelab.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - RHDH Local is **NOT a substitute for Red Hat Developer Hub**.
> - It is for development and testing only, **not for production use**.
> - It is designed for individual developers try out various RHDH features, not for teams as there is no out-of-the-box RBAC support.
> - There is no official, commercial support for RHDH Local. Use RHDH Local at your own risk.
